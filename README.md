• Implemented a NLP pipeline to classify emotions into eight classes and detect the gender of the speaker using the RAVDESS dataset.
• Trained and compared DL models MLP and CNN on audio features extracted like MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Rolloff, Mel and ZCR Voice using the Librosa library.
• Achieved test accuracy of 68% on emotion classification and ∼99.3% on gender classification using MLP architecture.
• CNN and LSTM Models are being worked upon.
